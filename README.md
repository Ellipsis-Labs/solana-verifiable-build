# Solana Verified Builds

This repository demonstrates how to implement verified builds for Solana programs. Verified builds ensure that your deployed program matches exactly with your public source code, promoting transparency and security in the Solana ecosystem.

## What are Verified Builds?

Verified builds allow developers and users to verify that a deployed Solana program matches its source code. This verification:

- Ensures program authenticity
- Promotes transparency
- Builds user trust
- Makes source code discoverable

## Quick Start

1. Install prerequisites:

   - Docker
   - Cargo
   - Solana Verify CLI (`cargo install solana-verify --locked`)

For production use, prefer installing from a tagged release.

2. Build your program:

```bash
solana-verify build
```

For programs that don't depend on `solana-program` (e.g. SDK v3 or pinocchio), add the Solana CLI version in your root `Cargo.toml` so the tool can pick the right build image:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.cli]
solana = "3.0.0"
```

The tool checks this first, then falls back to `Cargo.lock` (solana-program, solana-program-error, or solana-account-info).

3. Deploy and verify:

```bash
# Deploy
solana program deploy -u $NETWORK_URL target/deploy/$PROGRAM_LIB_NAME.so --program-id $PROGRAM_ID

# Verify against repository -> upload your build data on chain
solana-verify verify-from-repo -u $NETWORK_URL --program-id $PROGRAM_ID https://github.com/$REPO_PATH

# Trigger a remote job
solana-verify remote submit-job --program-id $PROGRAM_ID --uploader $THE_PUBKEY_THAT_UPLOADED_YOUR_BUILD_DATA
```

> The legacy `--remote` flag on `verify-from-repo` has been deprecated. Upload your PDA with programs upgrade authority, then run the `remote submit-job` command to queue OtterSec's worker. For a full walkthrough of the PDA workflow, see the [Solana verified builds guide](https://solana.com/docs/programs/verified-builds).

## Documentation

For detailed instructions and best practices, please refer to the [official Solana documentation on verified builds](https://solana.com/docs/programs/verified-builds).

## Security Considerations

While verified builds enhance transparency, they should not be considered a complete security solution. Always:

- Review the source code
- Use trusted build environments
- Consider using governance solutions for program upgrades

### Current Verification Scope

- Build images are selected by pinned digest.
- Solana/Agave installer scripts in generated Dockerfiles are checksum pinned.
- Post-install verification of installed toolchain/platform-tools is still follow-up work.

For responsible disclosure of bugs related to verified builds CLI, please email maintainers@ellipsislabs.xyz with a detailed description of the attack vector.

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

## Releasing

Use `.github/workflows/release.yml` (`Release`) as the canonical release path.
Use `.github/workflows/build.yml` only for manual artifact builds from a specific ref.

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for release steps and recovery procedures.
